This was a program I submitted while I was 
attend Central Texas College

The program uses two files: Teams.txt and WorldSeriesWinners

The Teams.txt file contains a list of BaseBall teams 
the user can select a team to see how many times the 
baseball team has won the world series championship

The WorldSeriesWinners.txt file contains a list of teams
that have won the world series. Each line represents a 
team that has won the world series. Repeating team names
conveys multiple world series championship wins 

The user chooses which team name to query the number of World series wins
